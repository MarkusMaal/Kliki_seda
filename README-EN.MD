# Click it 2.0
Simple game, where your goal is to click one button. But the game is actually much more difficult than it seems at first glance. Click it is the first C# game I ever wrote.
## How to play?
Move your cursor to the button and try to click it. If the button changes location before you manage to click it, try again... and again and again and again... You can try again until the attempt counter reaches the 63-bit integer limit (i.e. 2^63 - 1)
## Main features
* Choice between English and Estonian languages
* Color changing background, which can also be disabled
* Codes, which you can use to save the state of the game for yourself or share your game with others
* ? button
* Secret version 1.0 game! Can you find it?
